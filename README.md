# justgotothedamnurl-webextension

Firefox >=77 now searches when you enter perfectly legitimate URLs. Reverse this behavior with a search engine that just goes to the URL.

## Using

* Install from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/justgotothedamnurl/ or install the extension manually.
* In Firefox preferences, select the `justgotothedamnurl` search engine.
* Add a keyword for your primary search engine. For example, if you use DuckDuckGo as your default search engine normally, use something like `ddg`.
* Enter a local URL that Firefox tries to let search handle (eg `hostname.local`) which should now go to the actual website instead of searching for it.
* type `ddg search term` and verify that the search is perfomed.
